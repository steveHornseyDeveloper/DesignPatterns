# DesignPatterns
Implementations and thoughts on various design patterns and their relevance in JavaScript

## Why are desgin patterns are good? (incomplete)
Allows easier following of Single Responsibility principle. Abstracts periphery logic to other functions/classes making testing easier. Also can enable simplistic forms of dependency injection/Inversion of Control. 

## Still to do:

Abstract factory pattern - React components based on a config switch to define how the product should work

Compare decorator pattern to Higher Order Functions providing additional props in React

Adapter pattern

Visitor pattern

Proxy pattern

Bridge pattern

More???
